## Project Overview 🚀
### Purpose of the System
- The primary purpose of the Drone SOS system is to enhance emergency response efforts in various crisis situations, including natural disasters, medical emergencies, search and rescue operations, and fire incidents.
-  By providing rapid and real-time support to first responders, the system aims to reduce response times, increase situational awareness, and optimize resource allocation.
-  To enhance public safety, by offering a user-friendly interface for the public to report emergencies and to request assistance.
### Goal of DroneSOS system
-  The primary goal of the Drone SOS system is to optimize emergency response by reducing response times.
-  Drones can reach emergency scenes faster than traditional vehicles, providing critical support and data to responders when it matters most.
-  To minimize risks to first responders by automating certain tasks and allowing drones to go at hard-to-reach areas. 
### What problem does this system solve? and the Significance of our System
- Problem-1 : Traditional emergency response methods often suffer from delays in reaching at location.
- Solution-1 : The Drone SOS system solves the problem of delayed emergency response by dispatching autonomous drones rapidly.

- Problem-2 : Dealing with certain emergencies like wildfires or chemical spills can be very dangerous for the people who come to help first.
- Solution-2 : rones can access hazardous areas or environments without endangering human lives with low risks.
Briefly describe the purpose and goals of our AI project. What problem does it solve? What's its significance? This section should provide an exciting introduction to our project.

## Project Features and Functionality ✨
1. Emergency Reporting: Users can quickly report emergencies through our app.
2. Drone Dispatch: Drones are sent out automatically to emergency locations.
3. Real-time situational awareness :  Drones can provide real-time video and sensor data from the scene of an emergency, which can help emergency responders to quickly assess the situation and make informed decisions.
4. Enhanced Safety: Benefits include faster emergency response, improved situational awareness, and reduced risks for first responders. It's all about saving lives and protecting communities in times of crisis.

## How It Works 🛠️

- The user initiates the process by requesting emergency assistance, either through our application or a phone call for validation. 
- Once validated, an operator assigns the task to a specific drone and ensures the necessary supplies are loaded. 
- Users gain access to a live view and control of the drone throughout the operation. 
- Once the task is completed or supplies are handed over, the interaction concludes.

## Challenges and Solutions 🧠
Share any challenges our team faced during development and how you overcame them. This can include technical obstacles, data-related issues, or creative roadblocks.

## Future Enhancements 🚧
- Local drone station - so that task will be assigned to nearest drone by distance
- Data should me updated automatically in drones
- Obstacle avoidance
- Weather proof drones

## Screenshots and Demos 📸
Showcase the visual aspects of our AI solution through screenshots or videos. If possible, include a link to a live demo or video demonstration.
